The following is the textï¼š
Hello everyone, I would like to introduce several newly developed ABAQUS plug-ins, based on python apis, for your convenience:

1. Random ellipsoids are generated in two-dimensional rectangle and three-dimensional cube space

2. Random columnar fibers or line fibers are generated in two-dimensional rectangular or three-dimensional cube space

3. Generate polygon and polyhedron aggregates in 2D rectangle and 3D cube, customize the type, size and volume ratio

4, two-dimensional rectangle, three-dimensional cube generated circles, balls, customize the type, size and volume ratio

5. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional voronoi models are generated, and the grain distribution mode and matrix shape can be set

6. Three-dimensional periodic directional fiber generation

7, two-dimensional periodic circle, three-dimensional periodic ball generation

8. Hexahedral unit mapping and division of complex models

9. Random rust pits are generated on arbitrary geometric surfaces

10. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional capsule particles are generated

11. Two-dimensional images are imported into ABAQUS and converted into grid models

12. Import the.geo file generated by neper into ABAQUS to generate geometric models

13, three-dimensional sheet crack generation, two-dimensional line crack generation

14. Batch extraction of odb data
